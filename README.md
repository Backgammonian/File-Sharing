# File-Sharing
WPF-MVVM app for sharing any files between computers.
## What implemented in this project:
* Peer-to-peer architecture (each instance acts both as client and server)
* File server (shares files from local storage to remote clients)
* File client (connects to file servers, downloads desired files)
* Each client-server connection is encrypted by ECDH + AES-256 encryption scheme and each message is signed with ECDSA
* Each file segment has CRC32 checksum which is checked upon receipt
* File segments are compressed using gzip when transmitted
* User is able to see current and previous downloads/uploads
* The app can be hidden in system tray
* User is able to specify port for local file server
* The app checks if some of file segments didn't reach the client and automatically sends requests for missing segments
## âš  Warning
Encryption scheme implemented in this project may be vulnerable to various attacks such as MITM, replay attack, etc.\
This app may be not a very good option for sending sensetive data across Internet because it was created purely in education purposes.
